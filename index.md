R developer and data scientist.

## Projects

### [irishbuoys](https://johngavin.github.io/irishbuoys/) — Irish Weather Buoy Network Analysis

- **Live marine data** from 6 Irish coastal buoys via ERDDAP, with DuckDB-backed storage for fast analytics on millions of rows
- **Predictive wave models** using Random Forest, with interactive dashboards and automated weekly data updates
- **Fully reproducible** with Nix — one command (`./default.sh`) gives you every dependency, every time

### [randomwalk](https://johngavin.github.io/randomwalk/) — Asynchronous Pixel Walking Simulation

- **Fractal pattern generation** through parallel random walk simulations on a grid, with configurable movement neighborhoods and boundary behaviors
- **Parallel processing** with chunked mode for superior collision detection, plus browser-based demos via WebR/Shinylive requiring no installation
- **Interactive Shiny dashboard** for real-time parameter adjustment, with built-in plotting and statistics tracking

### [millsratio](https://johngavin.github.io/millsratio/) — Mills Ratio Analysis and Tail Thickness

- **Computes and visualises Mills ratios** across probability distributions to reveal fundamental differences in tail behaviour
- **Interactive 12-page dashboard** showing how distributions appear similar centrally but diverge dramatically in the tails
- **Practical analysis tools** for comparing distributions, verifying asymptotic behaviour, and Monte Carlo validation
